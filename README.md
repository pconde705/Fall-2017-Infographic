# Background
The a/A roster of students for the Fall 2017 cohort, the first group to enter the new halls, has experienced much. With amazing turnout and a rollercoaster of emotions during exam days, everyone had to crunch for hours learning new technologies. Each person has their preference, some of which they already knew coming in, others had never heard of the language before.

This project is centered on that cohort. Creating D3 visualizations of how everyone performed during exams, what their favorite technologies are and how people's different experiences came to help them or not. The amount of information one a/A class contains is boundless.

# Data

To create an interactive D3 arena, one that shows what we have been able to accomplish as a group as well as individuals serves as the foundation for all the visual charts.

Data will come from student queries, a/A publishings and testimonials. It will cover wide topics such as professional background to technology preference.

# Interactivity

Charts will allow you to choose between multiple factors that range from gender to age as well as between student choices like whether or not to do an original projects or a  clone. In an effort to celebrate the diversity of what we do everyday at a/A it will display the many differences and similarities between each student.

As this is a project it will obviously not mention individuals by name or any other reference. The student body serves merely as a foundation of data to be parsed and analyzed.

Sliders and click functions, as well as color play and zoom features will all be used to show differences in numbers. Hovering over exams will show who thought it was the most difficult, versus who thought it was the easiest.

Sliders will be used to narrow down data to make it more specific, increasing the factors allowing for more detail in individual numbers.
