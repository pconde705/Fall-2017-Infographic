# Background
Much has been adapted for Fall 2017 a/A, the first group to enter the new halls. With amazing turnout and a rollercoaster of emotions during exam days. Creating D3 visualizations of how everyone performed during exams and in combination with everyone's background of whether they have studied coding before or not. The amount of information one a/A class contains is boundless. 

# Data

To create an interactive D3 arena, one that shows what we have been able to accomplish as a group as well as individuals serves as the foundation for all the visual charts. 

Data will come from student queries, a/A publishings and testimonials. It will cover wide topics such as professional background to technology preference. 

# Interactivity

Charts will allow you to choose between multiple factors that range from gender to age as well as between original projects and clones. In an effort to celebrate the diversity of what we do everyday at a/A it will display the many differences and similarities between each student.

As this is a project it will obviously not mention individuals by name or any other reference. The student body is serve merely as a foundation of data. 

Sliders and click functions will as well as color play and zoom features will all be used to show differences in numbers. Hovering over exams will show who thought it was the most difficult, versus who thought it was the easiest. 

Sliders will be used to narrow down data yo make it more specific, increasing the factors allowing for more detail in individual numbers.
