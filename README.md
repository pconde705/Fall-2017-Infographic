<h1 align="center"> The Infographic of Class 'Fall 2017' </h1> <br>

# Background
The a/A roster of students for the Fall 2017 cohort is a diverse group of students that hail from many geographic and academic backgrounds that have come together to study web development. Using as my primary source of data the class of San Francisco Fall 2017, I will construct a visual infographic using primarily the D3 Javascript library, that chronicles the gender ratio, age ratio, as well as how many github repos each student has now that the term is coming to an end.

# Technologies

* react
* webpack
* D3

# MVPs

* functioning BAR chart with hover effects
* functioning PIE chart with hover effects
* functioning BUBBLE chart with hover effects
* styling to complement individual charts and page as a whole

# Data

Data will come from student queries, App Academy publishings and testimonials. It will primarily cover the gender ratio, age ratio, and the number of github repos each student has.

No external API will be used for data collection in this project. Data has been collected internally.

# Interactivity

Users will be see multiple charts on the front page, where some will have obvious overhead titles, whereas others you will need to mouseover to see certain effects and numbers that reveal more data.

The effects will show number data as well as simple movement animations. The movement animations for some graphs will be complimented with color change and size alterations.

# Schedule

Day 1,
* Add data to file, setup webpack and D3,

Day 2,
* Seed data properly to construct pie charts and bar charts

Day 3,
* Create first signs of interactivity, toggles and hover effects, and start bubble chart

Day 4,
* Finalize bubble chart and any sliders and/or toggles that selects between factors like age, gender, and github repos
